You will become a land owner and he’ll be the one to sit on the Tron. And so on until a new king rises.\n\n ach land you own in the kingdom gives you the right to claim a part of each new suitor's contribution.\n\n A 50% tax on each new purchased land is split equally between all existing land owners.\n\n As a land owner you can withdraw your tax earnings whenever you want, even if no king has been chosen yet.\n Your lands will always remain yours and you will keep getting tax earnings until a new king is crowned.\n\n You can buy multiple lands at once to become a huge land owner and make money with tax earnings on the back of future suitor.
